<b>Hi there, I'm George (Georgii) Paramzin.</b> I'm love good tea, cozy bookrooms, and spending time with my wife. But, if you're here to consider me for a job opportunity (which I hope you are), I'm also a skilled developer who loves bringing ideas to life.

As an <b>experienced backend developer</b>, I can take a project from start to finish and deliver quality results. While I'm not an expert in frontend development, I'm actively working on improving my skills in that area.

<b>My true passion lies in DevOps techniques and methods</b>, which I've dedicated myself to studying extensively. I believe that DevOps plays a critical role in the software development process, and I'm committed to mastering this field.

In addition to my technical skills, <b>I am also familiar with management methodologies</b> and have held leadership positions at several of my past workplaces. If you need someone to manage documents or move cards, I am eager to assist.

<b>I'm also know about test design and can write automatic tests</b> for web or API projects, although it's not my favorite skill to develop.

Overall, I'm confident in my abilities as a developer and excited to collaborate with you on interesting and innovative projects. Let's make something great together!
